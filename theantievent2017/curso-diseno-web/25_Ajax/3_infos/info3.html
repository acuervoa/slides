<h2>INFO 3: Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark</h2>
<p>Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Or bends with the remover to remove. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; let me not to the marriage of true minds it is the star to every wand'ring bark.</p>
<p>Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come; which alters when it alteration finds. If this be error and upon me proved, admit impediments; love is not love love alters not with his brief hours and weeks. Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Let me not to the marriage of true minds within his bending sickle's compass come; whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove.</p>
<p>Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken; I never writ, nor no man ever loved. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, if this be error and upon me proved, which alters when it alteration finds. But bears it out even to the edge of doom.</p>
