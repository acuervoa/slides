<h2>INFO 2: Which alters when it alteration finds</h2>
<p>Which alters when it alteration finds, whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks admit impediments; love is not love within his bending sickle's compass come. Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark or bends with the remover to remove.</p>
<p>But bears it out even to the edge of doom. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</p>
<p>It is the star to every wand'ring bark, or bends with the remover to remove. Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark. Which alters when it alteration finds, whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</p>
