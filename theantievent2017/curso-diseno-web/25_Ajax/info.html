<h2>Love's not time's fool</h2>
<p>Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks but bears it out even to the edge of doom. Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Which alters when it alteration finds, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, within his bending sickle's compass come. Admit impediments; love is not love oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark it is the star to every wand'ring bark.</p>
