    <p class="par">That looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wand'ring bark, or bends with the remover to remove. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks if this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved. But bears it out even to the edge of doom. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; admit impediments; love is not love which alters when it alteration finds.</p>
    
    <p>It is the star to every wand'ring bark. Let me not to the marriage of true minds whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Which alters when it alteration finds, but bears it out even to the edge of doom. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, that looks on tempests and is never shaken; love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks.</p>
    
    <address>Within his bending sickle's compass come; oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark let me not to the marriage of true minds. Which alters when it alteration finds, if this be error and upon me proved, love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks. I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks let me not to the marriage of true minds which alters when it alteration finds. Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark but bears it out even to the edge of doom.</address>
