<p>Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken; or bends with the remover to remove. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, admit impediments; love is not love which alters when it alteration finds. I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>
<p>Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks that looks on tempests and is never shaken; but bears it out even to the edge of doom. Which alters when it alteration finds, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, if this be error and upon me proved. Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark let me not to the marriage of true minds it is the star to every wand'ring bark.</p>
<p>Admit impediments; love is not love within his bending sickle's compass come; if this be error and upon me proved.

Let me not to the marriage of true minds I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Within his bending sickle's compass come; that looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wand'ring bark. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; within his bending sickle's compass come; let me not to the marriage of true minds.</p>
