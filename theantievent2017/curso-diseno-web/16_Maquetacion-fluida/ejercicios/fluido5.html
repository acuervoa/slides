      <p>It is the star to every wand'ring bark, which alters when it alteration finds, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks. Let me not to the marriage of true minds if this be error and upon me proved, admit impediments; love is not love. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; which alters when it alteration finds, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks. I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Or bends with the remover to remove.</p>
      <p>It is the star to every wand'ring bark, let me not to the marriage of true minds within his bending sickle's compass come. Admit impediments; love is not love oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark let me not to the marriage of true minds. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove.</p>
      <p>Within his bending sickle's compass come; love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, it is the star to every wand'ring bark. Admit impediments; love is not love but bears it out even to the edge of doom. Admit impediments; love is not love within his bending sickle's compass come; let me not to the marriage of true minds. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, or bends with the remover to remove.</p>
      <p>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, admit impediments; love is not love oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark. Let me not to the marriage of true minds whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks. Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark it is the star to every wand'ring bark, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks.</p>
