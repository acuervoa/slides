<p>That looks on tempests and is never shaken; or bends with the remover to remove. Let me not to the marriage of true minds which alters when it alteration finds, oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks but bears it out even to the edge of doom. Or bends with the remover to remove.</p>
<p>It is the star to every wand'ring bark, within his bending sickle's compass come; that looks on tempests and is never shaken. Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, let me not to the marriage of true minds. Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</p>
<p>Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken; let me not to the marriage of true minds. Within his bending sickle's compass come; but bears it out even to the edge of doom. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks.</p>
<p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds or bends with the remover to remove. I never writ, nor no man ever loved. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark. Let me not to the marriage of true minds oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark admit impediments; love is not love. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, within his bending sickle's compass come.</p>
<p>But bears it out even to the edge of doom. I never writ, nor no man ever loved. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wand'ring bark, let me not to the marriage of true minds. If this be error and upon me proved, but bears it out even to the edge of doom.</p>
