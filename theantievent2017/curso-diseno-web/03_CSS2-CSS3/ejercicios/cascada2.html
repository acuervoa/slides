<p>Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark or bends with the remover to remove. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, admit impediments; love is not love that looks on tempests and is never shaken. Within his bending sickle's compass come; I never writ, nor no man ever loved. But bears it out even to the edge of doom.</p>
