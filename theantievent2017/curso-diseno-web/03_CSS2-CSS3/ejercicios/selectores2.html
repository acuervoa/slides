<p class="negrita cursiva">Or bends with the remover to remove. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks let me not to the marriage of true minds love alters not with his brief hours and weeks. But bears it out even to the edge of doom. I never writ, nor no man ever loved. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, within his bending sickle's compass come; oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark.</p>

  <p class="negrita tachado">Let me not to the marriage of true minds that looks on tempests and is never shaken; whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Or bends with the remover to remove. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>
