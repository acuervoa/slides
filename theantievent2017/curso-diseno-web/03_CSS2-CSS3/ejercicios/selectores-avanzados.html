<h1>TÃ­tulo</h1>
<p>Admit impediments; love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, within his bending sickle's compass come. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, or bends with the remover to remove. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, if this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; but bears it out even to the edge of doom.</p>
<p>Admit impediments; love is not love within his bending sickle's compass come; oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark. Which alters when it alteration finds. Or bends with the remover to remove. Which alters when it alteration finds, let me not to the marriage of true minds but bears it out even to the edge of doom. Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, that looks on tempests and is never shaken.</p>
<p>I never writ, nor no man ever <strong>loved. Within his bending sickle's compass come; admit impediments; love is not love love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks. <em>Let me not to the marriage </em>of true minds love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, it is the star to every wand'ring bark.</strong></p>
