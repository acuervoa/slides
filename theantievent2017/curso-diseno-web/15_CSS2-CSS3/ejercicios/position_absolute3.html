  <p>Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark let me not to the marriage of true minds that looks on tempests and is never shaken. Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Or bends with the remover to remove. Which alters when it alteration finds, admit impediments; love is not love love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks.</p>
  <p>But bears it out even to the edge of doom. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, that looks on tempests and is never shaken; I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Let me not to the marriage of true minds.</p>
  <p>It is the star to every wand'ring bark, admit impediments; love is not love which alters when it alteration finds. Let me not to the marriage of true minds love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, within his bending sickle's compass come. But bears it out even to the edge of doom. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</p>
