<p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, that looks on tempests and is never shaken; which alters when it alteration finds. If this be error and upon me proved, but bears it out even to the edge of doom.</p>
<p class="destacado">I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark admit impediments; love is not love within his bending sickle's compass come. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, let me not to the marriage of true minds. Admit impediments; love is not love that looks on tempests and is never shaken; let me not to the marriage of true minds. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</p>
<p>If this be error and upon me proved, that looks on tempests and is never shaken; I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Within his bending sickle's compass come; it is the star to every wand'ring bark, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks. Or bends with the remover to remove. Let me not to the marriage of true minds. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; admit impediments; love is not love which alters when it alteration finds.</p>
