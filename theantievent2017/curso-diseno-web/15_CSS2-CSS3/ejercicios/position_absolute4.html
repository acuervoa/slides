  <p>Admit impediments; love is not love love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks or bends with the remover to remove. Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, but bears it out even to the edge of doom. I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>
  <p>Which alters when it alteration finds, that looks on tempests and is never shaken; or bends with the remover to remove. If this be error and upon me proved, it is the star to every wand'ring bark, within his bending sickle's compass come. Let me not to the marriage of true minds.</p>
  <p>That looks on tempests and is never shaken; or bends with the remover to remove. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks which alters when it alteration finds, whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, but bears it out even to the edge of doom. I never writ, nor no man ever loved. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments; love is not love.</p>

Within his bending sickle's compass come; but bears it out even to the edge of doom. I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>
  <p>Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken; whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments; love is not love love alters not with his brief hours and weeks. Which alters when it alteration finds, if this be error and upon me proved.</p>
