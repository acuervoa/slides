<h1>Admit impediments</h1>
<h2>That looks on tempests and is never shaken</h2>
<p>Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark admit <a href="#">impediments</a>; love is not love let me not to the marriage of true minds. Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. If this be error and upon me proved, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove.</p>
<p>That looks on tempests and is never shaken; but bears it out even to the edge of doom. <a href="#">Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken</a>. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, which alters when it alteration finds. Or bends with the remover to remove.</p>
