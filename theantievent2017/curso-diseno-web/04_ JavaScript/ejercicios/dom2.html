<p>That looks on tempests <strong id="mistrong">and is never shaken; within his bending sickle's compass come</strong>; love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, admit impediments; love is not love if this be error and upon me proved. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>
<p>Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark but bears it out even to the edge of doom.<strong> Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips</strong> and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come; whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. It is the star to every wand'ring bark. Which alters when it alteration finds, whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</p>
