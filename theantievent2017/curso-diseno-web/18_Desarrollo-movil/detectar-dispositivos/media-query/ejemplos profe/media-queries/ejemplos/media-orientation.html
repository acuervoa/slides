 <p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark which alters when it alteration finds. Within his bending sickle's compass come; but bears it out even to the edge of doom. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; or bends with the remover to remove. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks admit impediments; love is not love oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark.</p>
 <p>Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Within his bending sickle's compass come; love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks. Which alters when it alteration finds, admit impediments; love is not love whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark love alters not with his brief hours and weeks.</p>
 <p>If this be error and upon me proved, but bears it out even to the edge of doom. I never writ, nor no man ever loved. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark. Admit impediments; love is not love or bends with the remover to remove.</p>
