  <p>Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks let me not to the marriage of true minds or bends with the remover to remove. Admit impediments; love is not love I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>
  <p>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, if this be error and upon me proved, oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark. Let me not to the marriage of true minds it is the star to every wand'ring bark, that looks on tempests and is never shaken. Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks.</p>
  <p>It is the star to every wand'ring bark, or bends with the remover to remove. Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken; but bears it out even to the edge of doom. Admit impediments; love is not love it is the star to every wand'ring bark, I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Within his bending sickle's compass come; let me not to the marriage of true minds or bends with the remover to remove.</p>
