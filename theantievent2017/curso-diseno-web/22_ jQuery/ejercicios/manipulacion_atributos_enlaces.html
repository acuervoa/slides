    <p>Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks which alters when it alteration finds, within his bending sickle's compass come. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, or bends with the remover to remove. Let me not to the marriage of true minds I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks if this be error and upon me proved, it is the star to every wand'ring bark.</p>
    <p><a href="http://wikipedia.org">Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks</a>, let me not to the marriage of true minds oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark. That looks on tempests and is never shaken. Which alters when it alteration finds, whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments; love is not love that looks on tempests and is never shaken.</p>
