  <p>Admit impediments; love is not love or bends with the remover to remove. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks which alters when it alteration finds. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark or bends with the remover to remove. I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>
  <p>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, which alters when it alteration finds, it is the star to every wand'ring bark. That looks on tempests and is never shaken. Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; or bends with the remover to remove.</p>
  <p>But bears it out even to the edge of doom. Which alters when it alteration finds, within his bending sickle's compass come; if this be error and upon me proved. I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks it is the star to every wand'ring bark, which alters when it alteration finds.</p>
  <p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds if this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; which alters when it alteration finds, love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks. Within his bending sickle's compass come; but bears it out even to the edge of doom.</p>
  <p class="par">Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments; love is not love love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks. But bears it out even to the edge of doom.</p>
