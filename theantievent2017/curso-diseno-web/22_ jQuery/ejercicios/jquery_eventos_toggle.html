Within his bending sickle's compass come; that looks on tempests and is never shaken; but bears it out even to the edge of doom. Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, if this be error and upon me proved, or bends with the remover to remove. I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>
