  <h2>Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks whose worth's unknown. </h2>
  <p>Although his height be taken. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; within his bending sickle's compass come; if this be error and upon me proved. Which alters when it alteration finds, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark.</p>
        <p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments; love is not love I never writ, nor no man ever loved. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks. Or bends with the remover to remove. Which alters when it alteration finds, oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark love alters not with his brief hours and weeks.</p>
        <p>Admit impediments; love is not love but bears it out even to the edge of doom. I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Or bends with the remover to remove.</p>
