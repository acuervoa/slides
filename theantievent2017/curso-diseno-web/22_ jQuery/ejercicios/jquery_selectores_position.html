   	  <p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. It is the star to every wand'ring bark, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, which alters when it alteration finds. Admit impediments; love is not love that looks on tempests and is never shaken; whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Let me not to the marriage of true minds within his bending sickle's compass come; love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks. Admit impediments; love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, if this be error and upon me proved.</p>

        <p>I never writ, nor no man ever loved. That looks on tempests and is never shaken; admit impediments; love is not love it is the star to every wand'ring bark. Oh, no, it is an ever fixed mark which alters when it alteration finds, whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</p>
